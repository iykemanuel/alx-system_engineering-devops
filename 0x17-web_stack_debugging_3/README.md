## Task 0: Strace is your friend

### Objective

In this task, we identified and fixed an issue with an Apache server returning a `500 Internal Server Error`. The issue was diagnosed using `strace`, a powerful diagnostic tool that allows us to monitor the system calls made by a process. After identifying the root cause of the error, we automated the fix using Puppet.

### Diagnosis

Using `strace`, we attached to the running Apache process to observe the system calls being made. By running the following command:

```bash
sudo strace -p <pid_of_apache_process>
```

We were able to identify that the error was caused by a missing or incorrect PHP file (`class-wp-locale.phpp`) in the WordPress installation. The typo in the file extension `.phpp` instead of `.php` was leading to a `PHP Fatal Error`, which caused the server to return a 500 status code.

### Solution

To fix this issue, we created a Puppet manifest that:
1. Checks if the incorrectly named file `class-wp-locale.phpp` exists.
2. Renames the file to the correct name `class-wp-locale.php`.

### Puppet Manifest

The Puppet manifest file `0-strace_is_your_friend.pp` contains the following code:

```puppet
file { '/var/www/html/wp-includes/class-wp-locale.php':
  ensure => file,
  source => '/var/www/html/wp-includes/class-wp-locale.phpp',
}

exec { 'fix-wordpress':
  command => 'mv /var/www/html/wp-includes/class-wp-locale.phpp /var/www/html/wp-includes/class-wp-locale.php',
  onlyif  => 'test -f /var/www/html/wp-includes/class-wp-locale.phpp',
}
```

### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Run the Puppet Manifest**: Apply the Puppet manifest to automatically fix the issue.

    ```bash
    sudo puppet apply 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp
    ```

2. **Verify the Fix**: Check if the server is now returning a `200 OK` response.

    ```bash
    curl -sI 127.0.0.1
    ```

   You should see the following:

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    ```

3. **Test the Web Application**: Access the WordPress site to ensure itâ€™s working correctly.

    ```bash
    curl -s 127.0.0.1:80 | grep Holberton
    ```

    The output should show that the site title and other elements are loading correctly.
